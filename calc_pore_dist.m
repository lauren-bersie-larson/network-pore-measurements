%%% Calc_pore_dist.m
%%% Written by Lauren Bersie-Larson, 12-7-2020
%%% This function takes in an existing network and pore size threshold, and
%%% determines the distance a sphere the size of the pore size threshold
%%% can travel before intersecting a fiber or the end of the network. This
%%% process is done by randomly sampling the network 20,000 times. 

%%% Part of this code is a modified version of the code for the primitive 
%%% test "Closest Point on Line Segment to Point", and "Distance of Point 
%%% to Segment", as found on pages 127-130 of   
%%% "Real-Time Collision Detection", by Christer Ericson:
%%% Ericson, C. (2005). Chapter 5 - Basic Primitive Tests. In C. Ericson (Ed.), 
%%% Real-Time Collision Detection (pp. 125â€“233). San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann.

%%% INPUTS: 
%%% Nodes= Nx3 matrix of the X,Y,Z coordinates of the nodes(pts) in network
%%% Fibers = MX2 matrix of the fibers in the network. The two entries
%%% correspond to the two nodes that comprise the fiber
%%% x = the dimension of the network, in meters. To input 20 micron, use 20e-6, etc. 
%%% fiber_rad = radius of the fibers, in meters.
%%% Threshold = the pore size you are using, in meters. 
%%% Direction = Either 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to X, Y, or Z,
%%% respectively. 

%%% OUTPUTS:
%%% Avg_dist = the averaged distance traveled by a sphere of size threshold, 
%%% before hitting a fiber or end of the network, 
%%% in the direction specified. This is a scalar value.
%%% dist_traveled = A vector (sized 20,000) of all the distances traveled 
%%% by spheres of size threshold, before hitting a fiber or end of the network, 
%%% in the direction specified.
